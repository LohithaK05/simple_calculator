# simple_calculator

We used tkinter framework to write this code. It is a program that computes mathematical operations based on user input. We also used eval built-in function which makes the code a bit simpler. It performs all kind of arithmetic operations. We can also customize the color of the background and text and also change the size of every respective block according to our preference. We used a very friendly code which can support our requirements.

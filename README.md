# fun_with_flames

We have used Streamlit library to develop the FLAMES game. It is made by a user-friendly code by just dividing the logic into four steps. Every part of this code is completely customizable and we can add much more options to the front end. The result will be displayed instantly and we also added the option to rate the game.
